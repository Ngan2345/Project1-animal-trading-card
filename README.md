# Animal Trading Card

This is **Project 1** from **Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program**.

## 1. Description

In this project, I was provided with a template HTML file and the design prototype.  
I then modified the `card.html`, `styles.css` to make my card design resemble `design-prototype.png`.  
The original card is about fish, and my card `Bossy.png` is about West Highland White Terrier dogs.

## 2. Reference

The information in the card was collected from [(Jones 2021)](https://www.smalldogplace.com/west-highland-white-terrier.html).
